# Megaman X
This is a clone/tribute to a game that influenced how I approached obstacles!

## Background and Overview
Megaman X was the first game to really challenge me when I first started playing video games as a little kid. Games had been fun and whimsical but it felt satisying (and cool for lack of a better word) to progress through the levels in Megaman X. Looking back as an adult now, I am really impressed with how the introduction level simultaneously set the tone (pretty grim/mature for a kid) and introduced the player to the mechanics of the game without much hand holding. This clone will try to faithfully recreate what I feel is a great intro level to both a game and design in general. The project will be done utilizing canvas to render the background and vanilla javascript to recreate the mechanics of the game.

## Functionality and MVP
1. Background
Will utilize canvas to render the background, player models and enemies. Because this game is a side scroller, the screen will have to dynamically follow the player
2. Mobility
Will utilize javascript to control how the player moves Megaman depending on the player input (walking left, right and jumping). Want to implement wall sliding at some point. Enemies will render when the player reaches a certain point in the level and they will follow a set pattern of movements.
3. Projectiles
Megaman can shoot projectiles. If the projectile collides with an enemy, the enemy should be destroyed after a certain amount of collisions. Enemies can also shoot projectiles that damage Megaman.

2. Javascript
3. D3?

## Implementation Timeline
* Tuesday - Meeting with Coach, iron out gameplan. Finish initial setup, become familiar canvas and collect asseets (images, sprites etc).
* Wednesday - Attempt to render visuals, work on player movement (probably all single screen)
* Thursday - Figure out how to follow Megaman as he traverses the level, create enemies and iron mechanics out
* Friday/The Weekend - Hopefully put it all together

## Bonus Features
1. Sliding
Even though the original Megaman X game doesn't provide the ability to slide until later in the game, the mobility of the game is part of the reason why I fell in love with it in the first place.
2. Stage Selection, Introduction Animation/Text
Megaman X has a 'home' screen and introduction before the player starts the game. After the introduction level there is a stage selection screen.
3. Other Levels/Stages!
